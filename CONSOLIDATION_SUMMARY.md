## 🛠️ Local Development Workflow

### First Time Setup
```bash
./build-dev.sh setup
```

### Daily Development
```bash
# Make changes to code
./build-dev.sh format          # Format code
./build-dev.sh quality         # Check quality
./build-dev.sh test            # Run tests
./build-dev.sh build           # Build APK

# Or run everything at once
./build-dev.sh ci
```

### Before Pushing
```bash
./build-dev.sh ci              # Full CI pipeline locally
```
